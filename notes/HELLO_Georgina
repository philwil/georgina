HI Braidyn
Welcome to your second computer
This one is a workstation for all your other projects
You can write notes to me here if you want.

then use these commands

cd ~/work/braidyn
git add notes/*
git commit -m " update notes"
git push

Well I have made it a bit simpler
just type
gitstart

from anywhere
